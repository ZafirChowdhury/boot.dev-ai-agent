# AI Agent

Guided project from [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-ai-agent-python).

Do not run this program on your local machine! It does not have all the security and safety features that a production AI agent would have. It is for learning purposes only.

Things I learned from this 
- 

TODO
- Replace all custom path code with stlib code so it works with other os and envs.
